Lab created for CS3 Class. Purpose: We havenâ€™t worked with Queues in Java before, BUT when using a Queue, we have
to use another data structure (like a Linked List). That is because Queues are an
interface in Java, and we need a class that can implement the behaviors described
for Queues. Our goal is to create an actual class for Queues using a Doubly-Linked
List.Create a new class, in a separate file named Queue.java. This class must implement a
connected list of dNode objects, and you must not import the built-in LinkedList
class or the Queue interface. A dNode object contains data, as well as a reference
variable for the next and prev nodes. Modify your generic sNode class, now
named dNode, to reflect all the information described in a doubly-linked node.Our Queue class will be a Generic, and Circular Doubly-Linked List with a head and
a tail reference variable.
